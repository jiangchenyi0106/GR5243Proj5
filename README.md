+ Project summary: Sourcing from Kaggle, we obtained a dataset of 11 clinical features to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke. We chose Logistic regression SVM as our baseline models and explored whether oversampling techniques could improve the model performance on this unbalanced dataset. We also implemented cascade and boosting techniques on the baseline models, as well as more advanced models of random forest, decision tree, CNN, and Adaboost. 放结论进来

	

**Contribution statement**: 
All six of us contributed equally in the project.
Chenyi and Zerui collected, cleaned, wrangled and performed oversampling on dataset,and implemented baseline models. Hongju and Mingze implemented cascade and boosting techniuqes on the baseline models.Zixun and Junhan implemented CNN and Random Forest models. Additionally, Mingze did the final presentation.

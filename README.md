Project Summary: For this project we studied the algorithms related to Machine Learning Fairness Algorithms. We studied and implemented the algorithms given in papers A1: Learning fair representations (LFR) and A4: Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact. We used the Compas dataset to implement the algorithm.
Contribution Statement: We divided into 2 groups. Denise Rahmadina, Dongxu Zhang & Hongju Ouyang worked on paper A4. Hongyan Zhou, Yuxin Liang & Jinghan Huang worked on paper A1. Denise Rahmadina is the project manager for this project. All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
